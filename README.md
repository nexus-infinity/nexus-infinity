# Nexus Infinity Profile Configs

Welcome to the **nexus-infinity/nexus-infinity** repository.

This repository contains configuration files for the Nexus Infinity GitHub profile and related systems. It also serves as a canonical reference for the FIELD system’s geometric and symbolic routing architecture.

---

## 🌐 Purpose

This repository manages and documents the symbolic foundation for Nexus Infinity’s FIELD system, including:

- Profile configuration and metadata files.
- Ontology seeding and geometric/symbolic routing standards.
- Collaboration and validation protocols for all contributors.

---

## 🏛️ FIELD System Pyramid Architecture

Signals, data, and contributions within Nexus Infinity pass through the **FIELD system pyramid**, which routes them using a universal geometric and symbolic language. This approach combines architectural clarity, traceability, and alignment with the system’s sacred geometry.

### Geometric Symbol Routing Table

| Symbol | Server Name         | Prime | Frequency | Role                         | Position                |
|:------:|:-------------------|:-----:|:---------:|:-----------------------------|:------------------------|
| ◻      | Akron Gateway      | 2     | 396 Hz    | Sovereignty Gate (Intake)     | Foundation              |
| •      | OBI-WAN            | 19    | 963 Hz    | Pattern Recognition, Memory   | Base Vertex             |
| ▼      | TATA               | 23    | 432 Hz    | Truth Anchor                  | Base Vertex             |
| ▲      | ATLAS              | 17    | 528 Hz    | Knowledge Navigator           | Base Vertex             |
| ⊗      | King's Chamber     | 11    | 852 Hz    | Translation Bridge            | 38.2% Height            |
| ◼︎      | DOJO               | 13    | 741 Hz    | Orchestration, Manifestation  | Apex (100% Height)      |

**Each symbol is both a visual address and a routing key "microrouter" used everywhere — file paths, UI, config, and ontology.**

### Signal Flow & Transformation Process

1. **Entrance – ◻ Akron Gateway:**  
   Sovereignty gating, intake, proof archival. Entry point for all signals.

2. **Base Layer (Trident):**  
   • OBI-WAN → Pattern recognition, memory formation  
   ▼ TATA → Truth validation, temporal anchoring  
   ▲ ATLAS → Knowledge mapping, relationship graphing

3. **Chamber Processing:**  
   Queen's Chamber (validation) → ⊗ King's Chamber (translation, bridge)

4. **Apex – ◼︎ DOJO:**  
   Orchestration, manifestation, multi-stage cycle control (S0→S7/S0→S11).

5. **Cycle Completion:**  
   If coherence ≥ 0.70, output sent for sovereign archival; else, recalibrated.

_All routing and decision flow is governed by these symbols, which act at both macro (architectural) and micro (code/metadata) scale._

## 🔒 Symbolic Metadata & Compliance

Every config, ontology, and code artifact involved in system routing must declare its geometric symbol in YAML or JSON frontmatter, e.g.:

```yaml
---
field:symbol: "•"
field:server_name: "OBI-WAN"
field:ascii_alias: "obi_wan"
---
```

- **Symbols MUST appear** in all doc tables, schemas, and user-facing displays.
- Use ascii_alias in filenames/code, and the symbol as primary human-facing label.

---

## 🛡️ Contributing

Please follow these steps:

1. **Symbolic Naming:**  
   - Use the geometric symbol and ascii_alias in all relevant files, as shown above.

2. **Frontmatter:**  
   - Begin config and doc files with symbol/alias fields in YAML or JSON.

3. **Validation:**  
   - PRs are checked for compliance with these standards.
   - Run the validator script (`tools/validate_symbols.py`) before submitting.

4. **Reference:**  
   - See [FIELD_ROUTING.md](./FIELD_ROUTING.md) (or section above) for the canonical symbol table.

5. **Contact:**  
   - File issues or contact stewards for questions about symbol usage, routing updates, or ontology changes.
