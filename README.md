- **FIELD ontology:** Geometric and symbolic routing specification.
- **Collaboration protocol:** Source of standards for both human and machine contributors.

## FIELD Routing Architecture

The FIELD system implements a tetrahedral geometry with internal chambers for signal routing and addressing. Every vertex/chamber is mapped to a unique symbol, prime signature, and frequency anchor.

### Routing Table

| Symbol | Name             | Prime | Frequency | Role                        | Position              |
|:------:|:-----------------|:-----:|:---------:|:--------------------------- |:----------------------|
| ◻      | Akron Gateway    | 2     | 396 Hz    | Intake, sovereignty gate    | Foundation            |
| ●      | OBI-WAN          | 19    | 963 Hz    | Pattern recognition         | Base vertex           |
| ▼      | TATA             | 23    | 432 Hz    | Truth anchor                | Base vertex           |
| ▲      | ATLAS            | 17    | 528 Hz    | Knowledge mapping           | Base vertex           |
| ◆      | Queen's Chamber  | 7     | 528 Hz    | Validation                  | 20% height            |
| ⊗      | King's Chamber   | 11    | 852 Hz    | Translation bridge          | 61.8% height (φ⁻¹)    |
| ⭟      | Grand Gallery    | 31    | 639 Hz    | Central passage             | Origin (0,0,0)        |
| ◼      | DOJO             | 13    | 741 Hz    | Orchestration               | Apex (100%)           |

> **Symbols serve as visual identifiers in file paths, configuration frontmatter, UI, and ontology declarations.**

### Signal Flow

1. **Intake:** ◻ Akron Gateway receives and gates all inbound signals.
2. **Base Processing:** Signals route through the triad (●, ▼, ▲) for pattern recognition, truth validation, and mapping.
3. **Chamber Validation:** ◆ Queen's Chamber validates; ⊗ King's Chamber translates.
4. **Orchestration:** ◼ DOJO coordinates multi-stage cycles (S0→S7 or S0→S11).
5. **Output:** Coherent signals (≥0.70 threshold) archive to sovereign storage; others are recalibrated.

CONTRIBUTING.md             # Collaboration protocol
README.md                   # This file
```

## Metadata Convention

All configuration and ontology files must declare their geometric context in YAML frontmatter:

```
---
field:symbol: "●"
field:server_name: "OBI-WAN"
field:ascii_alias: "obi_wan"
field:prime: 19
field:frequency: 963
---
```

- Use `ascii_alias` in filenames and code paths.
- Use the **symbol** as the primary label in documentation, diagrams, and UI.

---

## Contributing

How to contribute:

1. Fork and clone this repository.
2. Add or modify ontology, geometry, or configuration files.
3. Declare symbol context in file frontmatter (see above).
4. Run tests locally:  
   `python geometry/test_grounding.py`
5. Submit a Pull Request. CI will validate:
    - Geometry compliance (≤2% tolerance)
    - Ontology shape
    - Symbolic metadata
6. Review and merge: Maintainers check semantic alignment and provenance.

See [CONTRIBUTING.md](./CONTRIBUTING.md) for the full protocol.

---

## Validation

The CI pipeline (`.github/workflows/ontology-validation.yml`) runs these checks for every PR:

- Geometry unit tests (23 specifications)
- SHACL ontology validation
- JSON-LD syntax validation
- Prime collision detection
- Frequency compliance

_All checks must pass before merge._
